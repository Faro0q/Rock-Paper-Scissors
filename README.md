# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Welcome to the game of Rock/Paper/Scissors where you play against
the computer.  On each move the computer will choose R, P, or S, then
the user will be prompted for their choice, and then the score will
be updated.  P beats R, R beats S, and S beats P. The score starts
at 0.  Add one if the person wins, subtract one if the computer wins.
The game ends if the score reaches -5 or + 5.
User input of 'x' or 'X' causes the game to exit.

Here we go!

Select how the computer chooses its move:
1. Always choose Rock
2. Random guess
3. Random guess with graphical score
Enter your choice
